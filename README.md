# Travel-agency
This is a website for the sale of tour packages. The assembly of the project is carried out with the help of Gulp. Ajax was used to load product cards. I draw your attention to the fact that the project is not fully posted, I will provide the rest of the code upon your request!

The site contains a menu (drop-down menu), a burger menu (for smartphones), a basket with goods, sliders-swipers (x4), product cards, downloadable using Ajax, a search and feedback form.
